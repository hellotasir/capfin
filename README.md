# CapFin

A project to showcase my skills in the Dart programming language and its associated frameworks.

### Why I chose this project as a Portfolio?

Financial apps require strong security and thorough testing before production deployment. So I’m using my own strategy and patterns to show you how I think as a system engineer or software developer, and also to showcase how I write and develop code.

### What I am developing in CapFin?

I’m developing a custom Dart backend using Dart Frog for transaction and audit log history. For the database, I’m using MongoDB. I’m also using Firebase and Supabase for other functionalities. I’m trying to use Google Apps Script as a REST API for sending emails and listing monthly or yearly reports in Google Sheets. For chat, I’m using WebSocket and Firestore. For notifications, I’m using webhooks. For video calling, I’m using WebRTC or the Agora SDK. I will try my best to use GraphQL as well in the project. I hope these are enough to showcase my backend development skills with API and integration with other technologies.

For the frontend, which we know as the user interface, I’m using Flutter Desktop (Windows only) for Admin or Banker interfaces, and Flutter Web + Android for users.

In summary, it is a complete platform (backend including database and API, and frontend including Flutter Web, Desktop, and Android) that demonstrates skills in system design and development. I’m not developing macOS or iOS versions or using GCP, AWS, or Azure due to limited resources or practice environment.

### AI vs Me

I’m not using AI in this because I feel it’s wrong as a developer. I support using it for time-consuming tasks and fast delivery. If AI tools were used in the project, it would require a lot of code review, which is why I’m not using them. This will help showcase my abilities in this field. As a human, I can’t remember everything, but analytical thinking and problem-solving skills in both technical and non-technical fields help me find solutions. I don’t believe in perfection but in quality and security. That means I prioritize system stability via maintenance over rapid development.

### Skills I am using in this project

Analytical Thinking, Decision Making, Technical Skills, Non-techincal Skills, and Problem Solving based on the situation.

### What is my goal in this project?

It is a permanent project that will be developed and maintained based on my free time or whenever I want. It will help me keep practicing Dart backend (Dart Frog) and Dart frontend (Flutter). Once I have other resource support or practice environment, I may add new platforms (macOS, iOS, and Embedded) or features like ML and AI.

### Project Update Policy

I will develop or maintain it based on my free time or whenever I want. If advanced resources are available, then I will make it a stronger project that defines me as a true developer.

### Warning

Do not copy or claim this code as your own. This project uses my custom packages and plugins. Attempting to use it without a deep understanding of Dart may hinder your learning and growth.

### Conclusion

A financial banking app just to showcase my expertise in Dart language and Flutter (Web, Desktop, and Android only). With resource support or available development environment, I can expand to more platforms (macOS and iOS) or add more features with GCP, AWS and Azure. Thanks for reading.
